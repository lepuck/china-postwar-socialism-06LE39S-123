# 06LE39S-123 Chinese Socialism in the Postwar World
Puck Engman

Chinese socialism is an important chapter in the global story of the postwar era. The end of World War II did not mark the end of conflict in China as it was followed almost immediately by the breakout of civil war. Armed conflict did not cease until 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on the mainland and the Guomindang set up its own government on the island of Taiwan. Like in other parts of the world, the postwar period saw China confronted both with the legacies of past violence and the emerging hostilities of the Cold War. By looking at the legacies of war and revolution together, this seminar allows students to consider how the history of the People’s Republic of China relates to global history in the late twentieth century.

Proseminar offered to undergraduate students at Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg in the Wintersemester 2019/20.
