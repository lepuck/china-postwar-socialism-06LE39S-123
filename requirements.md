### Preparation and participation

 For this seminar to be successful, there has to be a good environment for discussion in class. Therefore you are expected to participate actively in the discussion and to prepare outside of class by reading the assigned texts, taking notes, and preparing questions and comments. All readings are available via the ILIAS and HISinOne platforms.

Attendance is mandatory with a maximum of two absences for the entire semester.

### Session summary

The session summary should recapitulate in a few sentences the main points from the previous week's discussion and then raise one or two unanswered questions or propose related problems.

This exercise is meant to strengthen your ability to succinctly capture the broad strokes of an argument before presenting your own questions or views. More broadly, the summaries are intended to bridge the discussion as the class moves from one topic to the next one.

### Oral presentation

For the oral presentation you can choose between two options. The first option is a **reading response.**  This presentation serves to open up the class discussion of the weekly readings. You should select one of the assigned texts and one or several text(s) from the list of further readings or another text that you find relevant (feel free to ask me about additional texts beforehand). The presentation should briefly summarize the main arguments or points made by the authors, identify the types of sources used, connect the texts by pointing out similarities or conflicts between them, and above all raise issues or questions for further discussion in class (for example, by connecting the texts to earlier readings or topics you have discussed in other seminars).

The second option is an **essay outline.** In this way you can take advantage of the oral presentation to get feedback on your ideas for the essay (PL only). This presentation should summarize the topic you want to write about, engage with what historians have written on the topic in the past, and offer preliminary questions and arguments.

### Essay

The objective of the essay is to present a historical argument. This means that the essay should start out with a clearly defined problem and proceed to solve it through the analysis of historical events. Here, analysis refers to the way you describe, arrange, and contextualize the events to connect them to your particular perspective and the point you want to make. You can choose any topic relevant to recent Chinese history but in making your argument you should clearly formulate a framework for your narrative. By choosing a specific framework, events can be shown in light of broader historical trends (e.g. the global postwar era, the Cold War, the anthropocene, globalization and transnationalism) or let you explore how the inclusion of neglected stories can change the overall narrative (e.g. histories of women, the grassroots, sound, human-animal relations).

Regardless of topic and framework, the essay has to engage with the historiography. This means that you will have to include references to secondary literature and relate your own findings to what historians have said in the past. If you choose a topic only to find that little has been written about it before, you will have to think creatively about how your own topic might relate to more popular subjects and how literature on similar topics from other parts of the world or other time periods can be relevant.

Although many arguments can be made on the basis of secondary literature alone, others require empirical research using primary sources. As a principle, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself first with the secondary literature and look for primary sources when you already have an idea of what you want to write about. You can start looking for sources in the footnotes and bibliographies of the assigned texts, by searching for relevant keywords in the university library catalogue, on CrossAsia, or by consulting the list of resources below.

Your essay will be evaluated based on how well it meets the following criteria:

- The essay clearly states research question(s) and argument(s) in the introduction.
- The essay connects research question(s) and argument(s) to a clearly defined historical framework.
- The essay has a clear structure within each section and between sections.
- The essay balances careful and nuanced description with effective argumentation.
- The essay cites relevant evidence to back up statements.
- The essay engages with relevant historiography on the topic.
- The essay is consistent with the [institute guidelines](http://www.sinologie.uni-freiburg.de/studium/zusatzangebote/leitfadenhausarbeiten).

The essay should be approximately **2500 words** (+/- 10% is allowed, including footnotes and references).

A topic proposal of three to four sentences should be submitted together with a basic outline and a list of literature and sources by Friday, 20.12.2019.

The final essay is due **Friday, 06.03.2020**. To be submitted to: puck.engman@sinologie.uni-freiburg.de

The essay can be written either in English or German.
